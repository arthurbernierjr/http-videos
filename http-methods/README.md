# ![HTTP Request Response Cycle - HTTP methods](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to define the basic HTTP methods. 

## HTTP Methods

[HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) are used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a given resource on the server.

We'll be using the following HTTP methods when we start building our own server applications:

| HTTP method | Desired action on server |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| `GET` | The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data. |
| `POST` | The POST method is used to create a resource on the server. |
| `PUT` | The PUT method is used to update the specified resource on the server. |
| `DELETE` | The DELETE method deletes the specified resource. |
