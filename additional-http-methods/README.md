**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will get an overview of all of the available HTTP methods.

## Additional HTTP methods

There are many HTTP methods that you will likely encounter in your career beyond `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. It is helpful to be aware of the most common HTTP methods and to understand how they can be used. See this documentation from [Mozilla's developer network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) that explains the 9 most common ones.

If you choose to dig deeper and investigate the HTTP protocol specifics, you'll see that there are [39 different HTTP methods in HTTP1.1](http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml).

Even if an HTTP method is included in the protocol spec, that doesn't mean that all HTTP clients will support all of these methods, you most likely will not encounter the majority these verbs in your career, but it is helpful to understand how these protocols are designed and utilized.
